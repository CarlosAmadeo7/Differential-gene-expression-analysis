# Differential gene expression analysis: RNA seq 
1. This project was inspired by the objective of gaining proficiency in RNA_seq analysis, especially in performing differential gene expression.
2. In order to fulfill my objective, I decided to take data from the paper: "The E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Nedd4L Acts as a Checkpoint Against Activation in Quiescent Muscle Stem Cells": https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.10.540205v1
where the authors studied the role of Ubiquitin Protease in muscle stem cells with slow turnover and the effect of Nedd4L deletion in the exit of quiescence.
3. There are two datasets in this paper: Muscle Stem Cells vs Myoblasts, and Nedd4L_WT_KO_LFC_counts. For the purpose of this project, I have taken the first dataset of " Muscle Stem Cells vs Myoblasts " with 3 samples per cell tissue.
4. I chose to use pydeseq2 package for the task.
5.  All the code can be examined in the Jupyter Notebook present in the repository.
